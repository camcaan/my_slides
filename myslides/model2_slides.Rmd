# Aim of the study

---
class: middle

# The aim is to jointly model and explore the mediators associated with institutionalisation, hospital readmissions and mortality, and examine the effects of dementia patients profiles on the transitions between different states.

# Study Design

---
class: middle

# A retrospective cohort design, describing the rates of repeated hospital admissions, transition to an institution and death and the clinical factors affecting the rates of these events.

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# What Modelling approach and Why ?

---
class: middle, center

* **A multi-state modelling approach because standard time-to-event analysis such as Cox PH only takes into account time to first event and ignore the subsequent events**.

--

* **Various counting process or gap time models also has the limitation of treating terminal event such as death as censored, implying that the patients are still at risk of experiencing further recurrent events.**
???
repeated events can be modelled using Poisson models which estimate the rate of events by simply modelling total number of each event. To take time into consideration as well, then various counting process such as AG and prentice, willias and petrson (PWP), but these methds considers death as a censoring event.
--

* **To overcome these a MSM is recommended - it models the terminal event as an absorbing state, since no recurrent events can occur after this.**

???
the basic assumption of conventional survival analysis is that censoring distribution and event time distribution are independent.This means that individuals who are censored can be represented by those who remain under observation(subjects who are censored have the same survival distribution as those who are not censored).Treating a competing risk as censoring can violate the assumption of non-informative censoring. Individuals who experience the competing event may have a different prognosis for the event of interest compared to those who were neither censored nor experienced the event.

# Structure of the model

???
This model concern both hospitalisations and institutionalisation and will evaluate the factors associated with transition into an institution with respect to repeated hospitalisation or death.

# Multi-state data

---
class: middle



* **In ordinary survival data we have : time , status**


--


*  **In multi-state : time1, time2 and the status is a multi-level factor variable**


???
So, instead of covariates changing from line to line as in ordinary survival analysis, in MSM the status variable changes; it contains the state that was entered at time2.
--

* **We will need an id variable to indicate which rows of the data frame belong to each subject.**

##Covariates used 

* **Sex**

* **Dementia subtypes (Alzheimer's dementia, Vascular dementia & Unspecified/rare dementia)**

* **Exposure to anti-diabetic drugs a year before dementia diagnosis**

* **Exposure to anti-cardiovascular drugs one year before dementia diagnosis**

* **Frailty Index scores (Fit, Mild frailty, Moderate frailty, Severe frailty)**

* **Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI): CCI < 2, =2 and >2**

* **Index of multiple deprivation (IMD)**

* **Length of hospital stay : >= 12 days (Y/N)**

* **Admission due to injury (Y/N)**

* **Time since Index hospital admission (First admission after dementia diagnosis): 1 year, 2-4, 4+ **

* **Length of stay, admission due to injury and time since first admission were used as time-varying covariates**.

---

##Outcomes 




 **The outcomes of interest were**
 
 
 
 
 * **All-cause hospitalisations**
 
 * **Institutionalisation**
 
 * **All-cause death**


---

###Statistical analysis 



* **Multi-state Cox model using R survival library**

* **To investigate the covariates effect on each specific transition between two states**

* **Each transition in the MSM is a Cox type regression model**

* **We get the hazard ratios (HR) for each covariate effect on different transitions**

* **We also can estimate the probabilities of people in a particular state at a particular time**

* **Also, the time spent in each state by patients with specific profiles. Which is the sojourn time or the restricted mean survival time (RMST)**

# Predicted time in state curves
 ##Predicted survival curves## 
---
class:  middle, center
* **For predicted survival curves, we use the same `survfit()` call as Aalen-Johansen**

* **However, we need a target value of x**

* **Similar to in ordinary Cox model for example, with age and sex covariates,and we want to predict a survival curve, we have to provide values for a particular age and sex.**

#Summary

* **Male dementia patients were at greater risk of hospital readmission,  and death**

* **Female dementia patients were more likely to be institutionalised compared to men**

* **Patient who were also on anti-cardiovascular drugs had a greater risk of dying inside hospital as well as in institutional care**

* **Hospital readmissions increased with increasing frailty and increased comorbidity burden**

* **Institutionalisation decreased with increasing frailty and increasing comorbidity score**

* **With increased socio-economic deprivation, hospital readmission also increased**

* **Admission due to injury and long hospital stays increased the risk of institutionalisation and death**

* **Longer the time since first admission after dementia diagnosis, increased hazard of institutionalisation, death inside hospital and decreased readmission rate**.
